# My-Social-API-Network
Project Description: This API was built for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thought, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. I've created seed data in a separate folder in order to use on Insomnia where I'll be able to add more data once the API runs. Below is a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the app's functionality.

## User Story
```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
